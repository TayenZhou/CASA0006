Nug8W_G_hmkaL7A91OhPaw,wNvmhrTBmGimVHVZwKrmLw,3,1,0,0,"Actually, the food there was great, especially the fish filets, if you are a fan of spicy chinese food then it deserves a trial. The reason of why I gave 2 stars is because of the delivery service and the management work. I ordered fish filets and required a delivery, when the food arrived I found they delivery the wrong food, beef soup noodle. Then I called them for the right dishes and they did, but called me to pick it up in the resturant. If I could, why would I choose a delivery and paid the taxes and tips? That is the key fact I could not bear and it's their responsiblity to get the customer the right order and redelivery it.

Additional information, the waiter called me and said they could arrange a time and send me the right food at 2pm, but here is nearly 4pm and I almost starved to death waiting for my fish filets. Get some biscuits for the lunch(although it's 3pm) and I requested a refund but no one answered. And, for those who want to order for delivery, do think twice or at least ask the driver to stop for a while until you have check all your food are correct in the plastic bag. This is really a terrible experience.

Update: The owner do a compensation redelivery and apologized for the mistake happened last Saturday, attached a photo of the fish filet in the bag. Actually food was great and authentic.

C__RR9BBXuwXwNN5qoYxuQ,iLdVQodnexGgwcJYuW3mYw,1,2,0,1,"Sadly, I will never eat at this restaurant again.

On 5/29/2021, I, my wife and friends ate there and an order of meat patties was very undercooked. I didn't notice at the time because the rest of the food tasted great. However, I spent the next two days, Sunday and Monday of the Memorial Day weekend, on the couch and in the restroom. My wife also experienced an upset stomach, but less so than me because she ate less of the meat patties.

I understand that Covid-19 has caused issues for us all, businesses and restaurants included.

But when I called to speak to the restaurant manager on the morning of 6/2/2021 and he argued with me, that is when I chose to never go to that restaurant again and to post this review.

The manager, who did not give his name, only responded with ""this happened and Saturday and you're telling me now?"" I told him that since he's running a restaurant, he should know that there was a problem with the food. He never apologized, he never said he'd talk with the cook, he did nothing but argue with me and intimate that somehow I was wrong because I informed him of the problem a few days after the fact.

Whomever the owner of the restaurant is, I encourage you to at least retrain your cooks. I highly encourage you to replace the manager who answered the phone on the morning of 6/2/2021. I wasn't angry about the undercooked food and I'm still not. But as a retired veteran whose Memorial Day weekend was ruined by the meal I had there on Saturday, I did become very angry after talking to your uncaring manager.

We were greeted in a pleasant way by the Security guard named Andrew. Originally we requested to dine in the patio area but were instead directed by the waitress to sit indoors due to one of my nieces being 20 years old. The indoor option was to be seated in a small table evidently intended for guests of two which made spacing between us uncomfortable.
We then asked to speak to a manager to explore the possibility of being seated outside. The waitress was coarse in all her responses to us and visibly irritated throughout this time. When the manager arrived to our table one of my nieces began to make the inquiry before being rudely interrupted with a shouting response. He stated he was deaf in one ear when we gestured if he could lower his voice. The manager continued to shout and arrogantly explain that they had a long waiting list and we could not be accommodated. We were willing to overlook the situation considering we hadn't made a reservation.
Shortly after the same waitress came to take our order for drinks and appetizers. We placed our orders and requested a virgin margarita for my underage niece. As soon as we got our drinks we decided to take a video to post on social media. Before we could do so the waitress suddenly reached over the table and yanked the drink from my hand, placed it away from my niece and furiously blurted out that our alcoholic drinks could not be next to one another. She spitefully continued to say ""we are watching you"" insinuating we had careless intentions of letting our underage member drink. I responded that we did not need to be watched which was why we were led to sit inside in the first place and together as a group.
The appetizers were then brought in and took up most of the dining surface. A waiter then came to drop off the dinner selections for my nieces and daughter excluding myself. The waiter simply shifted the empty plates to my table corner when setting down the food but did not bother to remove them. After a considerable amount of time had passed a different waitress came with my dinner order. Instead of clearing the surface area or setting down my food, she casually stood next to me looking at me expecting me to take the dinner plate off her hands. After standing there she exclaimed and proceeded to remove the empty appetizer plates before setting down the food.

Overall this was a horrendous dining experience with extremely unprofessional and vindictive staff members. I can understand drinking policies for minors can be in place but in no way excuse such deplorable behavior.

Tucson has some adequate Thai food but I was unaware of anything REALLY good. I'm from Washington state, as anyone who has read my reviews probably knows. We have some excellent Thai restaurants in my home state, and over the nearly 15 years I've called Tucson home I've been searching in vain for one here. 

And now I have found one. 

We, actually, as DH will want to be included. 

This has been a very long week for us both - DH started a new position at work and ice been stressed out at work. I had most of the day off today, so I was able to recharge. And since tonight was date night, I decided on Thai food. 


DH found a place with glowing reviews that at first glance, we thought was near us. Except no. Originally I wasn't planning on going out and wanted either DH to pick it up or else have something delivered. Once we realized Saing was in Rita Ranch (we live near Campbell and Irvington) we thought about a place closer. But the delicious sounding menu and glowing reviews made me change my mind about going out. 

The restaurant is in the same strip mall as a currently infamous Rita Ranch coffee shop whose name rhymes with the last name of Indy racers Dick and Tom. But I don't want to give that guy any more attention, so anyway. 

DH had green curry, and I had the Thai cashew chicken. I love Thai cashew chicken, and that's high on my list of favorite things to make myself. Mind you, until tonight, I've never had a restaurant version as good or comparable to one I make myself. DH's cousin once told me mine was as good as the one at his favorite Thai place in Colorado. Mmmm. 

The curry was fantastic, creamy from the coconut milk and then you're hit with the punch of heat afterwards. Exactly the way a good curry should be. The chicken was delicious, flavorful and just spicy enough, with plenty of cashews and lots of glorious sauce. Oh my. 

This is also the kind of neighborhood joint where the regulars know the staff, so there was a lot of ""hey, how's it going, good to see you, how was your trip?"" which is always nice to see. I grew up in a small town with parents who knew *everyone* and to my dad, strangers are just friends you haven't met yet. I love that kind of energy! 

The elderly Thai man who works there was charming and funny, and very nice. Please keep him around! He's a gem. 

If you want quality, delicious Thai food at reasonable prices, this is the place to go. Don't just take my word for it, get off your butt and head out to Rita Ranch and experience it yourself. It's worth it. I promise.

Thank you, Saing Thai!",Tucson,positive,32.118663,-110.797634,4,341,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'HasTV': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}"", 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'None'}",Restaurants,2021

Upon opening the package we found the fish were alive but several were not what we ordered and of a lesser dollar value. The ""insulation"" didn't do a bit of good and the cold pack was totally melted after just a day in the mail. Another email and phone call were put through and (surprise!), went unanswered. We were trying to decide if we should attempt to reach out further, do a chargeback, or just live with the fish we got. It irritated me because these were not special fish...you could find any of these varieties at Petco for $3.99. My daughter didn't want to make waves so we decided to live with them.

After graduating out of pediatric services my daughter started bringing my grandaughter here after her birth. So the excellent care continues for our family! Office is clean and has plenty of comfortable seating. Staff are friendly and helpful at all times. Services are by appointment only. They do their best to see sick patients as soon as possible instead of making patients wait or referring out to an urgent care. Record keeping is accurate and I've always been able to access our medical record needs easily and quickly. I wouldn't go anywhere else!

#NAME?,94W90PLwpoFYqtuU-qBEGA,2,0,0,1,"This experience is about Feb 2020, when I frequented this store during the gem show.  

I started at this Tucson Palo Verde CW to ask about Add-a-Drawer.  Cashier who had only been working at that store 3 months, told me they do not carry it, cos he's never seen it.  I told him I saw it at that store before years ago.  He denied it.  I went to ask someone at the parts dept (HE should have done that!)  Lady there brought me right to where it was on the shelf.  I brought it to that cashier to show him, See you have it!  I looked it up on Ebay to see what prices they have and found they have larger sizes.  I called the manuf Smart Solutions on my phone and that man told me that Camping World online has the larger sizes.  When I went to parts to order, that man told me they do not carry it (cos he could not find it online).  I told him that the manuf/distributor told me CW orders it all the time and THEY HAVE IT!  

Parts employee didn't believe me so I put him on the phone with the Smart Solutions manuf and Smart Solutions helped CW parts find the larger size that I wanted.  So I was finally able to place my order, which the price was the same as the smaller in--store drawer.  

I am very turned off to the ""we don't have it"" when they do, attitude of the employees at the Tucson Palo Verde St store.  It is not about the names of these employees, it is about the MANAGEMENT,  No wonder that and other Az camping world stores (e.g. Mesa AZ where I picked up the drawer purchase) have such poor reviews on Yelp.

The only reason why I don't give 1 star is because the young lady at the counter when you first walk in, is very helpful.  She gets 5 stars, cos their internet was not working.  She was helping me try to get online with my laptop.  

Another reason why I would rate only 1 star, but the young lady at the counter lifts the review to 2, is because they do not have parking for RVs at this store, only because the parking spaces that is intended for RVs do not emphasize they are for RVs ONLY, so trucks and other passenger cars just park in the RV spaces.   The parking lot is very small.  There WERE very small words RV Parking in those long spaces, but they got worn away.  I told the manager that they need words that fill the entire space  RV PARKING ONLY !  But at the time I was there beginning of Feb 2020 (I was in Tucson for the gem show), there was no lettering in he RV spaces.  One employee told me 2 years before, that they even had a Smart Car parking in the long RV space.  Manager told me they are going to fill the RV parking spaces with big ""RV PARKING ONLY"", soon, do I hope that happened by the time you are reading this review.  

The story behind this inadequate parking situation is also because of poor upper level management.  When Corporate was looking for retail space for this store, someone at Corporate in another state back east, just looked at Google satellite view, and said ""This looks good enough"" and signed rental agreement for years based on ""satellite view"".  They also did not know that the business next to them had an easement through their parking lot, as it was the only way the neighbor could access their facility.  So when RVs have no place to park cos the cars are in the few RV parking spaces, RVers park in the road that the neighbor needs to get to work, or the RVs go into the neighbors parking lot to try to find parking there.  

All this is very poor management to MEEEE, in that Corporate did not want to pay to fly someone out to personally view the facility before signing a lease.  Now they are stuck with these problems for years and years.  

I had a $10 Good Sam coupon is the only reason why I was trying to buy the Add-a-Drawer at Camping World, otherwise a lot of the things they carry WalMart at 1/3 the price.  Honestly, I have specific examples such as the clear water carrier that costs more than double at Camping World than at Walmart.  See photo captions.  I think 85 percent of CW retail store merchandise here can be bought at Walmart for half the price.",Tucson,negative,32.165355,-110.918757,3,78,"{'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'True'}",RV Rental,2020

I had a flat tire with one of my run flats, drove straight to the dealership and was greeted and quoted $370 installed, I just needed to wait until the next day for them to get it in stock. I asked about a loaner car since I was 30 minutes from home and the woman told me there weren't any available and maybe I should try a tire place to get a new one installed same day (the tires are specific to Mercedes so no one had them in stock either)

I decided to go ahead and just go with Mercedes because I was there already. Upon entering the building over half of their employees were congregating without masks on, a few of them by the counter I was being helped at (around 6 ft away) I then spoke to the service desk and he originally wasn't wearing a mask either but put one on when I sat down.  I was then quoted $430 instead of $370. Again, already there so I agreed. He then said they did have loaner cars, not sure why the story changed from the first person to him.  A woman (I believe a manager) approached me and asked if she could help- she wasn't wearing a mask!  Do not speak to customers without a mask on. This is not the first week of mandated mask wearing - get with the program. 

When I got in my loaner car it was dirty!! There was a used mask and trash on the floor and ash on the seats. 

I don't feel like the Tucson Mercedes did a great job upholding the brand and wouldn't go there for service needs or a new car ever again. Very disappointed as I didn't feel like they had customer safety in mind. Masks aren't mandated by Mercedes although they are mandated by the city of Tucson.

I normally get at least 3 bids on a job around my house. I knew something was up when they wanted both my wife and I to be present during the visit. I told them on the phone that I would not be making a decision right away as I need more bids. When the salesman arrived he had no real knowledge of the product and did a quick bid on this IPAD and told me it would be around 3K if we sign right away or 7K if we didn't. I wanted more information about how they would install the product but he said he was a salesman not the installer. Once we signed the installer would come by and look at the house. He left without giving me a bid. A week later when I still had not received his bid I finally called him and he indicated there was some computer errors and would send out the bid the next day. The final bid is for over 16K over 5 times the original bid. Shady is a polite word for this type of bidding. His response to any questions I had on the pricing was that the company has been in busy for a long time and that should be good enough.....it's not for me.

I wanted a cargo rack and rear trail rack installed on my Jeep Wrangler. The service rep came back multiple times with quotes for parts that -- when I looked them up online -- were not compatible with my Jeep. When he finally got the right parts, I was told they were a little more expensive than the others I'd been quoted but the others were back-ordered. These would arrive in 3 weeks.  I agreed to the quoted parts and price. 

They took 3 months to arrive.  At the 8-week mark my rep mentioned that the parts were being custom-made, something that hadn't been mentioned previously.  

When they finally came in, I asked if all the parts were in and I was assured they were. I was told it would be a few hours to install. 

It took 3 days. 

On the 3rd day I was told the problem was that they didn't get the license plate bracket that goes with the bumper and so they were fabricating one.  The end result looked like something a 15-year old would make in shop class, a piece of sheet metal sticking through the center of the spare tire with an LED wired to the top of it.  

As I paid (more than $3000 for the setup), I was asked how I liked it. I said I wasn't thrilled. ""What can we do to make this right?"" I was asked. I said I would have preferred the proper bracket that was designed to go with the bumper rather than a makeshift one. ""We'll make that happen,"" I was assured.

A few weeks later I got a call that the bracket had arrived. I dropped off the vehicle and a few hours later got a call it was ready. It looked beautiful, very professional.  

""That'll be $479.00"" I was told. 

At no point was I told that I was being charged for the part, nor was I ever given a quote for the part and labor.  Pro-tip: If you're going to charge a customer for the privilege of letting you ""make it right"" for them, you may want to mention how much it's going to cost them. Especially if it's nearly $500 for a license plate bracket.

I'm giving 2 stars only because the work is lovely (albeit after the clumsy fabrication was corrected).
